# Embedded Software Engineer – DSA Mastery Checklist

Tick them off as you get comfortable implementing and using each of these.

## How to Use This Repo as Your Basepoint

1. **Fork this repository** into your own GitHub account so you can customize it and track your personal progress.
2. **Clone your fork locally** and open it in your editor/IDE.
3. **Use this checklist as your roadmap**: pick one topic at a time (e.g., arrays, ring buffers, FSMs) and focus on understanding + implementing it in C.
4. **Implement each item at least once in C**, preferably in a small, self-contained example under the relevant folder (e.g., `arrays/`, `linked_list/`, `RTOS/`). Use static memory where it makes sense for embedded systems.
5. **Mark the checkbox** once you can implement, explain, and reuse that structure/algorithm confidently in an embedded context.
6. **Commit your solutions regularly** with clear messages so you (and others) can review how your understanding evolves over time.
7. Optionally, **add notes or a personal log** (e.g., in a separate markdown file) about gotchas, performance tradeoffs, and how each concept maps to real embedded problems you’ve seen.

Feel free to adapt folder structure, add new problems, or extend the checklist to match your target domain (bare metal, RTOS, drivers, DSP, networking, etc.).

## Contributing

If you’ve used this as your basepoint and added useful examples, fixes, or new embedded-focused DSA topics:

- Open a pull request against this original repo with a short description of what you changed or added.
- Keep implementations in C (or very close to bare-metal/RTOS C environments) and prefer static or bounded memory usage where possible.
- Try to follow the existing folder layout when adding new implementations (e.g., arrays, linked_list, RTOS, DSP, etc.).

This way, others can benefit from your improvements and variant implementations.

> Goal: Implement each structure at least once in C.  
> Bonus: Implement one version with dynamic allocation and one with **pure static memory**.
